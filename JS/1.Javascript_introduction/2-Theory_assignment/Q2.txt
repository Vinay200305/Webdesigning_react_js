Question 2: How is JavaScript different from other programming languages like Python or Java?

=> JavaScript differs from other programming languages in several ways. 
    It has a C-style syntax, supports dynamic typing, and follows event-driven, asynchronous programming.

=> JavaScript code on a website gets processed on its own using the resources that are available on the system of the user. 
    Therefore, there is no need for any server-side browser to process the code.
