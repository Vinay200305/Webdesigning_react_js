Question 3: Discuss the use of <script> tag in HTML. How can you link an external JavaScript
file to an HTML document?

=> To include an external JavaScript file, we can use the script tag with the attribute src .

=> The value for the src attribute should be the path to your JavaScript file. 

=> This script tag should be included between the <head> tags in your HTML document.

=> Example:

<html>
  <head>
    <title>External JavaScript Example</title>
    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
  </body>
</html>
