question 1: Explain the setTimeout() and setinterval() function in javascript. How are theyused for timing events?

=> 1. setTimeout():
                setTimeout() allows you to execute a function once after a certain delay (in milliseconds).

=>Syntax:

setTimeout(callback, delay);

=>callback: The function you want to execute.
=>delay: The number of milliseconds to wait before executing the callback.

=>Important Notes:

The function only executes once after the specified delay.
The delay is not guaranteed to be exact (it may be slightly delayed depending on the execution context).

=>2. setInterval()
                  setInterval() is used to repeatedly execute a function at specified intervals((in milliseconds).

=>Syntax:

setInterval(callback, interval);

=>callback: The function to execute.
=>interval: The time interval in milliseconds between each execution.
