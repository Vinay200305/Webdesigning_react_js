question 2: provide an Example of how to use setTimeout() to delay action by 2 seconds.

=>Here's a simple example of how you can use setTimeout() to delay an action by 2 seconds. In this case, we

// Delay the action by 2 seconds (2000 milliseconds)
setTimeout(function() {
console.log("This message is shown after a 2-second delay!");
}, 2000); // 2000 ms = 2 seconds

=>How it works:

The function inside setTimeout() will execute after a 2-second delay.
After 2 seconds, "This message is shown after a 2-second delay!" will be logged to the console.

You can replace the console.log() with any other action you want to delay, such as updating the DOM or calling
another function.

Let me know if you'd like more examples!
