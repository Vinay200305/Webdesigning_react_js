Question 1: What is error handling in javascript? Explain the try, catch, and finally blockswith an example.

Error handling in JavaScript is the process of managing runtime errors (exceptions) that occur during 
the execution of a program. Without proper error handling, an error can cause the entire program to 
crash or behave unexpectedly. JavaScript provides a way to handle errors using the try, catch, and
finally blocks.

=>1. try block:
    The try block contains the code that might throw an error. If any error occurs inside the try
block, the control is transferred to the catch block (if present).

=>2. catch block:
    The catch block is used to handle the error that occurs inside the try block. It takes an 
    argument (usually error or e) that contains the error information.

=>3. finally block:
        The finally block contains code that will run after the try and catch blocks, regardless 
of whether an error occurred or not. It's useful for cleanup activities (e.g., closing a file or releasing
resources).

=>Syntax:

try {
// Code that may cause an error
} catch (error) {
// Code to handle the error
} finally {
// Code that will run after the try and catch blocks (optional)
}
