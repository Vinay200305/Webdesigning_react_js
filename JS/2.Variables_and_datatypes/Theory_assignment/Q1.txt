Question 1: What are variables in JavaScript? How do you declare a variable using var, let, and const?

=> In JavaScript, variables are used to store data values.

=> Declaring Variables:

1. Using var:
-> Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their scope, but their value is undefined until the assignment is made.
-> Example : var x = 5; // Declare and initialize
            console.log(x); 

2. Using let:
-> Variables declared with let are hoisted but remain in a "temporal dead zone" until the declaration is encountered.
-> Example : let y = 20;  // Declare and initialize       
            console.log(y);

3. Using const:
-> Like let, const is also hoisted but remains in the "temporal dead zone.
-> Example : const z = 50;  // Declare and initialize
            console.log(z);
