//Question 2: Explain the different data types in JavaScript. Provide examples for each.

//=> JavaScript has 7 primitive data types and 1 non-primitive data type:
//=> Primitive Data Types:

//1) Number: Represents numeric values (integers, floats)
//-> Example : 
        let age = 25;
        let price = 9.99;

//2) String: Represents a sequence of characters.
//-> Example : 
        let name = "Bruce";
        let greeting = 'Hello, World!';

//3) Boolean: Represents a logical value, either true or false.
//-> Example : 
        let isStudent = true;
        let isLoggedIn = false;

//4) Null: Represents the intentional absence of a value.
//-> Example : 
        let emptyValue = null; 

//5) Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
//-> Example : 
        let notDefined;

//6) Symbol: Represents a unique and immutable value, often used as keys in objects.
//-> Example : 
        let id = Symbol("user_id");

//7) BigInt: Represents a whole number larger than the maximum number that can be represented by the Number type.
//-> Example : 
        let bigNumber = 123456789012345678901234567890n;

//=> Non-Primitive Data Type:

//1) Object: A collection of key-value pairs.
//-> Example : 
        let person = {
            name: "ROBERT",
            age: 30,
            isStudent: false
        };
