// => undefined: Indicates a variable that has been declared but not yet assigned a value.
// => Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value.

// => undefined: Automatically assigned to variables that are declared but not initialized.
// => Null: Must be explicitly assigned to a variable.

// => undefined: Used by JavaScript when a variable is not assigned a value.
// => Null: Used intentionally by developers to indicate “no value” or “empty”.

// => undefined: undefined is a global property with the value undefined .
// => Null: null is a global property with the value null .

// => undefined: undefined values are omitted during serialization.
// => Null: null values are preserved during JSON serialization (e.g., {“key”: null} ).
