Question 1: What are the different types of operators in JavaScript? Explain with examples.
o Arithmetic operators
o Assignment operators
o Comparison operators
o Logical operators

=> JavaScript provides various operators to perform specific tasks. Here's a breakdown of the four main types of operators along with explanations and examples:

1. Arithmetic Operators:
=> Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.
=> Example:
    let a = 10;
    let b = 3;
    console.log("Addition: " + (a + b));      
    console.log("Subtraction: " + (a - b));   
    console.log("Multiplication: " + (a * b));
    console.log("Division: " + (a / b));      
    console.log("Modulus: " + (a % b));       
    console.log("Increment: " + (++a));       
    console.log("Decrement: " + (--b));       

2. Assignment Operators:
=> Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. They can also perform operations like addition, subtraction, etc., while assigning.
=> Example: 
    let x = 10; 
    console.log("Initial Value: " + x); 
    x += 5; 
    console.log("After +=: " + x);
    x -= 3; 
    console.log("After -=: " + x);
    x *= 2; 
    console.log("After *=: " + x);
    x /= 4; 
    console.log("After /=: " + x); 
    x %= 2; 
    console.log("After %=: " + x); 

3. Comparison Operators
=> Comparison operators compare two values and return a boolean (true or false).
=> Example:
    let a = 10;
    let b = "10";
    let c = 5;
    console.log("Equal to (==): " + (a == b)); 
    console.log("Strict equal to (===): " + (a === b));
    console.log("Not equal to (!=): " + (a != c));
    console.log("Strict not equal to (!==): " + (a !== b));
    console.log("Greater than (>): " + (a > c)); 
    console.log("Less than (<): " + (c < a));
    console.log("Greater than or equal to (>=): " + (a >= c));
    console.log("Less than or equal to (<=): " + (c <= a));

4. Logical Operators:
=> Logical operators are used to combine multiple conditions or invert them. They are often used in decision-making.
=> Example:
    let age = 25;
    let hasLicense = true;
    if (age >= 18 && hasLicense) {
        console.log("You can drive!");
    } 
    else {
        console.log("You cannot drive.");
    }
    
    let hasPermit = false;
    if (age >= 18 || hasPermit) {
        console.log("You are eligible for driving.");
    }
    let isAdult = false;
    console.log("Is not an adult: " + (!isAdult));
