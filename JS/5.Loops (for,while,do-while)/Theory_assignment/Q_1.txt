Question 1: Explain the different types of loops in JavaScript (for, while, do-while). Provide a
basic example of each.

1. For Loop
=> The for loop is used when you know the number of iterations beforehand. It consists of three parts:

    -> Initialization: Sets the starting value of the loop counter.
    -> Condition: Determines how long the loop runs.
    -> Increment/Decrement: Updates the loop counter after each iteration.
=> Example:
let arr = [5, 3, 8, 1, 2];
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < arr.length - 1 - i; j++) {
        if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {
            let temp = arr[j];
            arr[j] = arr[j + 1];
            arr[j + 1] = temp;
        }
    }
}
console.log("Sorted array (for loop):", arr);


2. While Loop
=> The while loop is used when the number of iterations is unknown, and the condition is evaluated before each 
iteration.

=> Example:
let arr = [5, 3, 8, 1, 2];
let swapped = true;

while (swapped) {
    swapped = false;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
            let temp = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[i + 1];
            arr[i + 1] = temp;
            swapped = true;
        }
    }
}
console.log("Sorted array (while loop):", arr);

3. Do-While Loop
=> The do-while loop is similar to the while loop but guarantees at least one execution because the condition is 
checked after the code block is executed.

=> Example:
let arr = [5, 3, 8, 1, 2];
let swapped;

do {
    swapped = false;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++) {
        if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
            let temp = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[i + 1];
            arr[i + 1] = temp;
            swapped = true;
        }
    }
} while (swapped);

console.log("Sorted array (do-while loop):", arr);
