Question 2: What is the difference between a while loop and a do-while loop?

=> While Loop: The condition is checked before the loop body is executed.
=> Do-While Loop: The condition is checked after the loop body is executed.

=> While Loop: The loop body may not execute at all if the condition is false initially.
=> Do-While Loop: The loop body is guaranteed to execute at least once, regardless of the condition.

=> While Loop: Used when the loop should only run if the condition is initially true.
=> Do-While Loop: Used when the loop must execute at least once before checking the condition.

=> While Loop: javascript while (condition) { // Code }
=> Do-While Loop: javascript do { // Code } while (condition);

=> While Loop: Suitable for pre-validation.
=> Do-While Loop: Suitable for post-validation or initialization tasks.
