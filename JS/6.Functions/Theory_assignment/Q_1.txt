
Question 1: What are functions in JavaScript? Explain the syntax for declaring and calling a
function.

=> A function in JavaScript is a reusable block of code designed to perform a specific task. Functions make code 
    modular, maintainable, and reusable.
=> Code Reusability: Write once, reuse multiple times.
=> Modularity: Break the program into smaller, manageable parts.
=> Improved Readability: Functions describe what a block of code does.
=> Ease of Debugging: Isolate issues in smaller code blocks.

=> Syntax for Declaring a Function:
    1. Function Declaration:
        -> example:
            function functionName(parameters) {
            // Code to be executed
        }
        -> functionName: The name of the function, used to call it.
        -> parameters: Input values that the function accepts (optional).
        -> Code Block: Contains the logic that executes when the function is called.

    2. Calling a Function
        -> Invoke (execute) a function by using its name followed by parentheses.
        -> example:
            functionName(arguments);
        -> arguments: Values passed to the function for its parameters.
