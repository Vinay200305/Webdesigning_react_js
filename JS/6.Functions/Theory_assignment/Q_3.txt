Question 3: Discuss the concept of parameters and return values in functions.

=> Functions in JavaScript are powerful tools for creating reusable, modular code. 

=> Two key concepts in functions are parameters and return values. 

=> These allow functions to accept inputs, process them, and provide outputs.

=> Parameters are placeholders or variables defined in the function declaration to accept input values when the 
    function is called.

=> The return statement specifies the value a function should output to the caller. 

=> A function can have a return statement to send a result back or perform an action without returning a value.
