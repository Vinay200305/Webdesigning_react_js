Question 1: What is an array in JavaScript? How do you declare and initialize an array?

=> An array in JavaScript is a special variable that can hold multiple values, instead of just a single value. 

=> Arrays are used to store collections of data, such as a list of numbers, strings, or objects. 

=> They allow you to store multiple items under a single variable name, and these items can be accessed by their 
    index (position) in the array.

=> Arrays can be declared using array literals or the new Array() constructor.

=> You can access and modify elements in an array using their index.

=> Common array methods include push(), pop(), shift(), and unshift().
