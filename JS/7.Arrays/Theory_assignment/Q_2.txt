Question 2: Explain the methods push(), pop(), shift(), and unshift() used in arrays.

=> push(): Adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.
-> Example:
    let fruits = ["apple", "banana"];
    fruits.push("orange"); // fruits is now ["apple", "banana", "orange"]

=> unshift(): Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length of the array.
-> Example:
    let fruits = ["apple", "banana"];
    fruits.unshift("grape"); // fruits is now ["grape", "apple", "banana"]

=> pop(): Removes the last element from an array and returns that element.
-> Example:
    let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
    let lastFruit = fruits.pop(); // lastFruit is "orange", fruits is now ["apple", "banana"]

=> shift(): Removes the first element from an array and returns that element. 
-> Example:
    let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
    let firstFruit = fruits.shift(); // firstFruit is "apple", fruits is now ["banana", "orange"]
