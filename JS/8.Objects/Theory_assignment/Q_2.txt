Question 2: Explain how to access and update object properties using dot notation and
bracket notation.

1. Dot Notation:
    => Accessing Properties:
        -> In dot notation, you use a period (.) followed by the property name to access a value.
        -> The property name must be a valid identifier (a string without spaces or special characters, except underscores 
            or dollar signs).

        => Updating Properties:
            -> To update a property, you simply assign a new value using dot notation.

2. Bracket Notation:
    => Accessing Properties:
        -> In bracket notation, you use square brackets ([]) and pass the property name as a string (i.e., inside quotes).
        -> Bracket notation is useful when the property name is dynamic or contains special characters (spaces, hyphens, etc.), which dot notation cannot handle.

    => Updating Properties:
        -> You can also update properties using bracket notation by assigning a new value.

=> Dot notation is the most commonly used way to access or update object properties, but bracket notation is 
    necessary when dealing with invalid identifiers or when using variables to access properties dynamically.
