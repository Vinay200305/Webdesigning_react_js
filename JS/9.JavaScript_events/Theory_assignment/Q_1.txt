question 1: what are javascript events? Explain the role of event listeners.

  =>Events are typically generated by user interactions with the page or system events like page loading. 
  Some common types of events include:

   =>Click: Triggered when an element is clicked.
   =>Mouseover: Triggered when the mouse pointer moves over an element.
   =>Keydown: Triggered when a key is pressed down.
   =>Load: Triggered when the page finishes loading.
   =>Submit: Triggered when a form is submitted.
   =>Resize: Triggered when the window is resized.

  =>Role of Event Listeners
                            An event listener is a function that "listens" for an event to occur on a particular
  element and then executes a specified piece of code when that event happens. Event listeners allow you to handle events in a dynamic way.

  =>Hereâ€™s how event listeners work:
                                    Binding an Event Listener: You bind an event listener to an element (like a
    button) so that the browser knows which event to listen for (e.g., "click").Triggering the Event: When the
    event occurs (like the user clicks the button), the browser triggers the listener and runs the associated 
    code (the callback function).

  =>For example:
