qouestion 2: How does the addEventListener() method work in javascript?provide anexample.

=>The addEventListener() method in JavaScript is used to attach an event handler (or listener) to an HTML
  element. It listens for a specific event (like a click, keypress, mouseover, etc.) and executes a function
  when that event occurs.

=>Syntax of addEventListener()
  javascript

=>element.addEventListener(event, function, useCapture);
=>event: A string representing the name of the event (e.g., "click", "keydown", "mouseover").
=>function: The callback function that will be called when the event occurs.
=>useCapture (optional): A boolean value that indicates whether the event should be captured during the
  capturing phase or the bubbling phase. The default is false (bubbling phase).

=>How It Works
        =>Identify the element: You select the element you want to listen to (e.g., a button, a form input).
        =>Choose the event type: You specify the event (e.g., click, mouseenter, submit).
        =>Define the callback function: You provide a function that will run when the event happens.
